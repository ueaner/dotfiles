    # Launch or Focus terminal
    bindsym $mod+Return exec swaymsg '[app_id="Alacritty"] focus' || $term
    # Launch floating terminal
    bindsym $mod+Shift+Return exec $term --class 'term-float'

    # Kill focused window
    bindsym $mod+q kill

    # Start launcher

    # Drag floating windows by holding down $mod and left mouse button.
    # Resize them with right mouse button + $mod.
    # Despite the name, also works for non-floating windows.
    # Change normal to inverse to use left mouse button for resizing and right
    # mouse button for dragging.

    # Reload the configuration file
    bindsym $mod+Ctrl+r reload

    # Lock screen, just enter the password to enter the system

# Scratchpad:
