# Basics:

    # Start a terminal
    bindsym $mod+Return exec $term
    bindsym $mod+Shift+Return exec $term --class 'term-float'
    for_window [app_id="term-float"] floating enable

    # Kill focused window
    bindsym $mod+q kill

    # Start launcher
    bindsym $mod+Space exec $menu

    # Drag floating windows by holding down $mod and left mouse button.
    # Resize them with right mouse button + $mod.
    # Despite the name, also works for non-floating windows.
    # Change normal to inverse to use left mouse button for resizing and right
    # mouse button for dragging.

    # Reload the configuration file
    bindsym $mod+Ctrl+r reload

    # Lock screen, just enter the password to enter the system
    bindsym $mod+Ctrl+q exec $lock

    # Exit sway

# Scratchpad:
#
    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
    # You can send windows there and get them back later.

    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
