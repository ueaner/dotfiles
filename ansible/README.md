# Setup Linux Workstation

- Building a [macOS-ish Desktop Environment] (Shortcuts and Gestures) based on GNOME or Sway
- [Programming Languages Environment]
- [Terminal Environment]
- Install common [packages]
- etc.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

Make sure you can access the network. If there is no wireless network, try the following for now:

1. Wired Network (Network cable)
2. USB Tethering (USB data cable) and (If on Android, Enable USB debugging)
3. Bluetooth Tethering

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ansible controller:

```bash
export PYTHONUSERBASE=~/.local

# install & upgrade pip
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade --user
python3 -m pip install -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple --trusted-host mirrors.aliyun.com --upgrade --user pip
# install ansible
python3 -m pip install -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple --trusted-host mirrors.aliyun.com --user ansible

~/.local/bin/ansible --version
```

Target devices:

- Enable the sshd service `sudo systemctl enable sshd`.
- SSH login without password `ssh-copy-id <host>`.

## Let's gooooo

Specify the Ansible configuration file by setting the [ANSIBLE_CONFIG] environment variable, so that you don't need to specify the `-i /path/to/inventory` parameter for a specific task.

```bash
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=~/ansible/ansible.cfg
```

List all-packages of the packages role:

```bash
yq '... comments="" | .packages | keys' <~/ansible/roles/packages/vars/main.yml
```

Download the package to be used.

```bash
~/.local/bin/ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml --extra-vars "role=packages task=download" --tags all-packages
```

Initialize the macOS-ish desktop environment (Shortcuts & Gestures), programming language environment, terminal environment and common [packages].

```bash
~/.local/bin/ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml --ask-become-pass
```

Update programming language versions and common [packages].

```bash
~/.local/bin/ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml --tags all-packages
```

Install/upgrade go, rust, zig, node and other programming language versions.

```bash
~/.local/bin/ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml --extra-vars "role=packages" --tags "go"
```

Install/upgrade lazygit, tldr and other common [packages].

```bash
~/.local/bin/ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml --extra-vars "role=packages" --tags "lazygit"
```

## Features

Initialize the desktop environment, programming language environment, terminal environment and common [packages].

The flags used in ansible task:

- Device: MacBook(aqua, gnome), ChromeBook(sway)
- System: macOS Darwin, Fedora Linux 41+
- Desktop: aqua, gnome, sway

Such as the [Github task lists]:

- [x] To mark a task as completed

## Ê≥®ÊÑè‰∫ãÈ°π

1. tags: starting with the main.yml file, add tags to the task
   - ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml -vvv --tags "download" --list-tasks
   - ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml -vvv --tags "install" --list-tags
   - ansible-playbook ~/ansible/linux.yml -vvv --tags "go"

2. [ansible-lint rules]: Avoid checking by adding comments `# noqa rule-name`, where `rule-name` can be seen in the execution results of `ansible-lint`.

3. [All three possible ways of ignoring rules]
   - `noqa` inline -> for individual tasks
   - `skip_list` in config file -> for general deactivation
   - `.ansible-lint-ignore` -> for deactivation on file level
